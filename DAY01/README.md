# 📅 Day 1 – Band Name Generator 🎸

## 📌 Project: Band Name Generator

Today marks the **first day** of my **100 Days of Python** journey!

For this project, I created a fun **Band Name Generator**. It takes two simple inputs from the user — the city they grew up in and their pet’s name — and combines them to suggest a unique band name!

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use the `input()` function to take user input
- How to store input in variables
- How to use `print()` to display output
- Basics of string concatenation

### 🧪 Code Used

```python
user_city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in: ")
user_pet_name = input("What's your pet's name: ")

print("Your band name could be", user_city + " " + user_pet_name)
```
### 🎯 Sample Output
```bash
What's the name of the city you grew up in: Toronto
What's your pet's name: Biscuit
Your band name could be Toronto Biscuit
```

### 🔗 What's Next?
Tomorrow, I’ll continue building on these fundamentals and dive deeper into variables, data types, and Python syntax!
