# 📅 Day 4 – Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✊✋✌️

## 🎮 Project: Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

On **Day 4**, I created the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game using Python. This is a fun way to practice working with **user input**, **conditional logic**, and **random number generation**.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use the `random` module to generate unpredictable outcomes (computer's choice)
- Taking and validating **user input** using `input()` and `int()`
- Implementing **game logic** with multiple conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Comparing user and computer choices to determine the winner
- Using **lists** to store ASCII art for better game visuals and code organization
- Structuring code cleanly with a `main()` function

---

### 🎯 Game Features

- Player is prompted to choose between Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2)
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options
- ASCII art is displayed for both the player’s and the computer’s choices
- Game determines and displays the result: win, lose, or draw
- Handles invalid input gracefully

---

### 💡 Concepts Practiced

- Input validation
- Using lists for efficient storage and retrieval
- Game design thinking (rules, outcomes, and user interaction)
- Basic use of Python's `random.randint()`
- Output formatting and visual feedback with ASCII art

---

This game provided a hands-on approach to logic building and gave me a better understanding of how to make interactive CLI games in Python. Stay tuned for Day 5!
