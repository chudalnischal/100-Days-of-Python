# 🐍 100 Days of Python 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** challenge!

## 📚 About

I'm starting a journey to master Python from scratch by committing to **100 days of consistent learning and coding**. Each day, I’ll explore new concepts and build small projects or exercises to solidify my understanding.

I'll be following the **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** course by **Dr. Angela Yu** on Udemy.

> This journey is not just about completing a course — it's about building a solid foundation in Python and applying what I learn through hands-on coding.

## 🛠️ What to Expect

- 🧠 Daily learning of core Python concepts  
- 💻 Projects and exercises every single day  
- 📈 Continuous improvement and consistency  
- 📂 Well-organized folders by each day (Day 1, Day 2, ..., Day 100)  

## ✅ Goals

- Learn Python programming from the ground up  
- Apply Python to build real-world projects  
- Stay consistent for 100 days  
- Share my progress with others  

## 📅 Progress

I'll update this repo every day with code, notes, and reflections on what I’ve learned.

✅ **Day 1:** [[Folder/Link](https://github.com/chudalnischal/100-Days-of-Python/blob/main/DAY01/README.md)]
